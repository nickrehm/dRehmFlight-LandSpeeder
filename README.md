## Overview

dRehmFlight is the flight controller for hobbyists, hackers, and non-coders interested in stabilizing their wacky and unique flying creations. The code and supporting documentation is built to bring someone up to speed on VTOL flight stabilization concepts as quickly and painlessly as possible. The code is written and presented in a way that is intuitive, easy to follow, and most importantly: all in one place. No more digging through countless folders and confusing classes just to add an 'if' statement for your custom drone application. This flight controller uses an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, so there is no confusing flashing or compiling process necessary. If you can use Arduino, you can start expanding the capabilites of this flight controller to your liking.

dRehmFlight has been used as a teaching tool for aircraft stabilization and flight control principles in universities and tech companies around the world. It is not meant to out-perform other flight controller packages on the market, or be used in a commercial sense. It is best suited for rapid prototyping or allowing a radio control hobbyist to get their feet wet in flight control code for their VTOL project. Much more information is included in the dRehmFlight VTOL Documentation .pdf.

This code is entirely free to use and will stay that way forever. If you found this helpful for your project, donations are appreciated: [Paypal Donation](https://www.paypal.me/NicholasRehm)

**New in Beta 1.3:**

- Spektrum DSM Satellite RX Support
- One-time IMU calibration
- ESC calibration functionality
- Motor arming bug fix
- Code and comment clean up
- Small bug fixes


### Hardware Requirements
This flight controller is based off of the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller and MPU6050 6DOF IMU. The following components (available on Amazon) are required to complete the flight controller assembly:


**Teensy 4.0**: https://amzn.to/3oFG3QN

**Alternative Links**: [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15583), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4323), [Electromaker](https://www.electromaker.io/shop/product/teensy-40?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCYcZsU4tRXVgeqfOOJyg_zPV2MXTeJM2QwJ6zafMTsCb6MjWthk7r8aAn6hEALw_wcB)

Due to supply chain issues, the Teensy 4.0 has been frequently out of stock throughout 2022. The Teensy 4.1 is generally in stock more often and is immediately compatible with the dRehmFlight pin mappings (plus you get extra bonus pins!): https://amzn.to/3c1OSSw


**GY-521 MPU6050 IMU**: https://amzn.to/3edF1Vn

These (and all Amazon links contained within the supporting documentation) are Amazon Affiliate links; by purchasing from these, I receive a small portion of the revenue at no cost to you. I appreciate any and all support!

### Software Requirments
Code is uploaded to the board using the Arduino IDE; download the latest version here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

To connect to the Teensy, you must also download and install the Teensyduino arduino add-on; download and instructions available here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
